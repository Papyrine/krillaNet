# text/kerning

Kerning pairs, at a size that makes a fraction of an em visible. AV, LT, Wa and To are the classic
ones: the pair is drawn tighter than the two advances would place it.

This is the scenario the corpus could not have before. Text used to be measured by summing raw hmtx
advances, which ignores kerning entirely, so `reset.css` disabled it in the browser to keep the two
sides comparable. Shaping through krilla's own rustybuzz removed that concession, and the third
paragraph checks the consequence that actually matters: with the wrong widths, a line breaks in the
wrong place.

**Boxes**: 5 matched, worst offset 0.00px, worst size 0.00px.
