Ligatures, where shaping changes the glyph count rather than only the spacing: fi and fl become a
single glyph, so the text measures narrower than its characters would suggest.

The cluster mapping matters here as much as the width. A ligature covers several characters with
one glyph, so its text range spans them all — get that wrong and the PDF's text extraction returns
the wrong characters for the run even though the page looks right.
