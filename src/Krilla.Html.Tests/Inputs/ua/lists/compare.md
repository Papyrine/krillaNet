# ua/lists

List indentation, which AngleSharp omits entirely — before the corrections an unstyled list had no
padding-left at all and sat flush against the margin. Also covers the nested case, where the inner
list drops its vertical margins so a multi-level outline reads as one block.

List markers are not drawn, so the bullets and numbers a browser shows are absent from the render.
That is a real gap and it shows in the pixel metric; the box geometry is unaffected, because a
marker sits outside the principal box.
