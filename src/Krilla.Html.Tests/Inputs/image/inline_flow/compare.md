# image/inline_flow

An image is an atomic inline: it flows on the line like a word, breaks before or after but never
inside, and sits its bottom edge on the baseline. Because it is 32px tall in a 24px line, it pushes
the line's top upward rather than growing it downward, which is what baseline alignment means for a
replaced element.

**Boxes**: 4 matched, worst offset 0.00px, worst size 0.00px.
